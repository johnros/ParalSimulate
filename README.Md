# On the Optimality of Averaging in Distributed Statistical Learning

This code accomanies the "On the Optimality of Averaging in Distributed Statistical Learning" manuscript by [J. Rosenblatt](http://www.john-ros.com/) and [B. Nadler](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~nadler/).
The files are structured as follows:

1. The pkg folder includes the functions required to run the simulations, as an R package.
2. The output folder includes the different figures produced for the manuscript.
3. The Rdata folder includes the data outputted by the simulations used for plotting, but is not uploaded to github. You can ask the authors for the folder, or simply run the code to reproduce the data.
4. The different files in the root directory run the simulations and produce the plots.
